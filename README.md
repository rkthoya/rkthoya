Hello there 👋
------
You can call me Richard, everyone does. I'm a computer programmer currently in Nairobi, 🇰🇪. At the moment my focus is on back-end web development and server-side scripting. I'm an avid pythonista 🐍 - like many others I came for the language and stayed for the community. That said, I'm not a tech-stack nazi 😄. I'm happy to pick up any language or tool that best solves the problem at hand.

#### Skills.
* Server-Side Web Development.
* Scripting and task automation.
#### Languages and Tools.
* Python. 
* Django. 
* PostgreSQL. 
* SQLite. 
* Bash.

I'm currently working on a portfolio of personal projects. For starters you can check out the [new-site](https://github.com/rkthoya/news-site) and [podgretor](https://github.com/rkthoya/Podregator) repos pinned to my profile here.

I'm also learning about [API Design](https://apiacademy.co/api-certification/).

To reach me, shoot an email to rkthoya@proton.me or you can slide into my DMs on Twitter [@rkthoya](https://twitter.com/rkthoya).
